Business Intelligence Assignment:

1) With Jio coming in there has been a spike in internet users from Tier 2 and Tier 3 is because tier 2 and tier 3 users are not economically very strong and thus online shopping for these internet users is not a regular habit and hence what they enjoy from the internet are the services that are free which are video/content apps like youtube and tiki tok.
And also the currently most played game in India is Pubg and its gameplay contents are available on youtube where players players who have a huge fan base stream their game on youtube hence amassing a lot of viewers.And people in India like to follow celebrities to a great extent and hence use tik tok a lot so that they can catch most of the action from their favourite star/celebrities. These content being free and with the introduction of high speed internet from Jio users from tier 2 and tier 3 are using these apps a lot more than e-commerce websites.

2) Nymtra's new onboarding design is not a success becausse the rate of increase in first time buyers and the revenue earned from them is more or less same from that of before the month of April( Time of Introduction of the new design) and also the rate of second purchase from FTBs also decreased drastically.

3) 
	i) The users will be more relieved after the introduction of caraousel because they won't have to search a lot for contents similar to their taste.
	ii)Primary goal should be to keep the users more engrossed in the app and hence keep them subscribed for a longer duration of time. This feature should be analysed on parameters like increase in in-app time or watch time.
	iii) This feature should be introduced with a selection of languages a user prefers to watch a movie or series in and the genre,length/duration etc.
